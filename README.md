## Description deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever suddenly realized that you needed some ingredient for a meal, some replacement part, some event to look into, then gone to write it down but either forgot it before finding where to write it, or couldn't find where you wrote it down later? Use Noted to note down everything you might forget, and add it immediately to categories of your own making - grocery lists, spare parts, or people to respond to - so your lists don't get lost.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML pages for category viewing, note adding, and login/about page.
- **CSS** - Style options to make them look nice. Make categories look cool.
- **JavaScript** - Login, possibly animate note making.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - submit notes
  - view categories
- **DB** - Store categories and notes in categories in database.
- **Login** - Register and login users.
- **WebSocket** - As a user adds a note, it's sent to the web server to be added to a category. When viewing a category, all the corresponding notes are displayed.
- **React** - Application ported to use the React web framework.

## HTML deliverable

- **HTML pages** - 
- **Links** - 
- **Text** - 
- **Images** -
